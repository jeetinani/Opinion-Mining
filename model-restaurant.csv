reviews,Rating
But the staff was so horrible to us.,0
"To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.",0
"The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.",1
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.,1
"For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.",0
"Not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great.",1
It is very overpriced and not very tasty.,0
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).,1
"The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.",1
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.,1
"i've noticed megadeth, mr. scruff, st. germain, traditional vietnamese songs, black sabbath, jay-z, and daft punk all being played.",1
"They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.",0
"It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!",1
The design and atmosphere is just as good.,1
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.,1
I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts.,1
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.,1

We were very disappointed.,0
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE.,1
I really liked this place.,1
I will be going back very soon.,1
"All the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs.",0
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.,0
It was pretty inexpensive too.,1
Will not be back.,0
"Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods.",1
My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes.,1
"Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.",1
This isn't a value joint.,0
Faan's got a great concept.,1
A little rough on delivery,0

"Great food at REASONABLE prices, makes for an evening that can't be beat!",1

The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth's is the Strip House.,1
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.,1
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.,1
You'll adore it.,1
Two words: Free wine.,1
The price is reasonable,0
The service is poor,0
"The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.",1
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.,0
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.,1

The fried rice is amazing here.,1

it's a perfect place to have a amazing indian food.,1
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.,1
At the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup.,0
There was hardly any good thing present at the restaurant,0
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money.,1
but do not come here on a empty stomach.,0
The food was delicious ,1
The wine list is excellent.,1
so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster.,1

They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.,1
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.,1
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner.,1

The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.,0

Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.,1
I've never been treated so rudely.,0
I'll be back soon.,1
Le Pere Pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding.,1

We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason.,1
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.,0
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.,1
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.,1

Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC.,1
"I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.",0
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).,1
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.,1
This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to.,1
This restaurant used to be pretty decent.,0

"If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!",1
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.,1

Plenty of choices to make your own creation.,1
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.,0
Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it,1
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.,1
VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up.,1
"From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.",0
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.,1
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen.,0
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end.,1
"Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.",1
Not impressed with the food.,0
The entire dining experience was wonderful!,1
The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.,1

Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.,1

"Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.",0
"Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).",0

The fried platter was more greasy,0
"What is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the food is really good.",1

"Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.",0
"The food is great, service is ok.",2
"The overall price tag was very very expensive, something I did expect.",0
"Spice is great Thai food, love the inexpensive appetizers.",1
"Read all the other review, they'll confirm it that they are the best in business.",1
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.,0
The service was attentive.,1
"He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh.",1
Fish was overdone.,0
"Great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.",2
"When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.",1
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service.,1
I have been twice to this restaurant.,1
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection.,0
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros.,0
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style.,1
"The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.",1
Good food.,1
"The staff is very friendly, if not overly efficient.",2
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.,0
The dim sum however was very good.,1
It's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.,0
Service has always been friendly and efficient.,1
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers.,2
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.,1
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.,0
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.,0
Prices are very good.,1
"We could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.",0
Fantastic place.,1
Plain and simple it's bad thai food.,0
Definitely not a restaurant to skip!,1
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.,0
I was in a dilemma when i went there as some things were good some were bad,2
"While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the food is not really the point.",2
"The Dim Sum was so-so, but not spectacular.",2
The food was so-so.,2
"The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.",0
"The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.",1
What a disaster,0
Threw my fiance's surprise 30th birthday dinner here couldn't be happier.,0
You can do it here.,2
Food is awesome.,1
"good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.",1
"There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.",1
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.,2
"May, the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you.",1
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.,1
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.,2
The sides were ok and incredibly salty.,2
It hits the spot every time,1
"For some reason, all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon.",0
"Not a large place, but it's cute and cozy.",1
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.,2
and there's no way out.,2
"The beverages were excellent, and the dessert was good.",1
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.,0
"Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.",0
"Please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed.",1
I must say the view of the waterfront is so beautiful from the restaurant,1
"If you'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent, Long Tan is a good place on the slope.",1
"When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.",1
"For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out.",0
"Otherwise, this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere.",0
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service.,1
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.,0
A++   The service was good to excellent along with the attitude.,1
"This is my fourth try over a two year period, and I'm done.",0
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass.,1
"The music does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander.",1
black white shakes came out good also.,1
It's simply the best meal in NYC.,1
Probably would not go again...,0
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.,2
"The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant, so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here.",1
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken.,2
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon.,2
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place (the first being Joya).,2
"However, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot.",1
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.,1
"This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.",1
"my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread, but all the bagles are unbeliavably good.",1
"I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too.",0
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.,0
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.,1
"Also good for client lunch meetings, esp.",1
For $600 ( the most we have ever paid) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance.,0
"The decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low prices.",1
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.,1
The setting is casual and romantic.,1
IT WAS HORRIBLE.,0
"Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.",0
"Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.",1
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.,1
"The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner...",0
"As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.",1
"I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.",1
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.,1
"The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.",1
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.,1
"Emilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.",1
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner.,1
"Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!",2
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged.,0
"A cheap eat for NYC, but not for dosa.",2
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.,2
"The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.",1
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.,2
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread).,2
"($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).",2
"Really though, where's the seasoning?",0
"The food was just OK, at least for what food was available.",2
"by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!!",1
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!,1
"The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.",2
"Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.",1
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.,1
"We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.",1
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.,2
"otherwise, good stuff for late nite eats.",1
"The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.",2
It is thick and slightly soggy.,0
Its not the same if you have to sit inside.,2
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence!,1
"I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's.....",1
Great people watching as others do the same to you.,1
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.,0
"Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu.",1
He offers subpar service and has no personality.,0
"The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.",1
I'm going back.,1
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer....,0
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years.,1
"wow! how have i missed this one ,tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew.",1
"Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf(ok bad joke), but you will see.",1
"While we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.",0
Me and my girls will definitely go back.,1
"The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.",2
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.,1
"delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.",1
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in.,1
All the food was hot tasty.,1
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.,1
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza.,2
Our server was very helpful and friendly.,1
Try green curry with vegetables.,2
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash.,1
While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!,1
This place was not ALL THAT!,0
"First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.",0
"The second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.",1
Much more reasonably priced too!,1
"If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.",1
"The food was not very tasty, the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant.",0
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.,1
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten.,0
Why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it?,2
"The Pad Thai is excellent here, as well.",1
Big and gawky on the outside.,0
I have been to Mary's many times and I like it.,1
"Searching to get out from the cold, freezing weather, we went into what we thought was a deli.",2
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant.,0
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!,1
This is the best thing in Soho.,1
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience.,1
"We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.",1

"For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.",2
"The food is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.",2
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.,1
I think the stuff was better than Disney.,1
"After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.",1
"While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.",2
"Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.",1
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it!,0
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.,0
"Well, their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold.",0
The staff is no nonsense.,1
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.,2
Wonderful at holiday time.,1
And really large portions.,1
The place is a lot of fun.,1
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff.,1

"As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.",2
"The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.",1
"In fact, two people could really share one plate.",1
The food is great and authentic.,1
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.,1
during happy hour!,2
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers.,1
Love YUKA.,1
"Anyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list.",1
"Go, go, hurry, before everyone finds out about it.",1
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.,2
I am bringing my whole family back next time.,1
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.,1
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.,1
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.,0
But the coconut rice was good.,1
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.,0
A guaranteeed delight!,1
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years.,1
Overall I would recommend it and go back again.,1
The food was great.,1
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.,1
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.,1
All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.,1

Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.,1
"The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.",1
"Umm, some what good taste",2
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.,1

Definately check it out!!!,1

I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again.,0
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.,1
"I was a little leary about Mary's at first - it's small, crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I'm glad I finally tried it.",1
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.,1
Also very inexpensive.,1

The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.,1
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!,1

Go inside and you won't want to leave.,1
I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get.,1

I would go back tho.,1

I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.,1
"The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).",1
This is where the aforementioned line was.,2
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.,0
"Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....",0

We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.,1

"We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.",1
"My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.",1
We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.,0
The food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.,2
I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good.,1
"Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!",1

"The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy.",2
"It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.",0
"Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).",1
"Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.",1
"Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.",0

"The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.",1
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.,0
"Late nite omelletes are not good here, there is no variety!",0

I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there.,0
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing.,0
"Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.",1
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.,1
"A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.",2
"In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.",1
I definitely wouldn't go back.,0
It is not worth for that bucks.,0
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere.,1
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.,1

The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.,0
"All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!",1
"Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.",0
Service is top notch.,1
The food now is inconsistent.,0
All pretty good.,1
"You can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.",1
you guys rock.,1
Chance is a joke.,2
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer.,2
BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice.,2
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.,0
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.,0
I was at Rao's last Wed.,2
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.,0
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.,1
"The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.",1
Service was quick.,1
Tends to turn people away.,0
We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.,2
"I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since.",1
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!,0
Went there for an office lunch.,2
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!,1
"Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.",0
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.,2
"We've been following chef Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return.",1
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops.,1
it's delicious!,1
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we've ever had.,1
"Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.",2
"In addition, the food is very good and the prices are reasonable.",1
"Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts.",1
"If you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!",1
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.,0
"Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices.",2
I never had anything I didn't like here.,0
Reasonable prices.,1
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.,1
"Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.",1
It won't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food.,0
"All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.",1
I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again.,0
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!,0
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.,2
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.,1
"if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side).",1
"No refills on fountain drinks, though.",0
Wow over 100 beers to choose from.,1
Be careful of portions - they're HUGE.,1
"The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.",1
My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.,1
Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening.,1
Did I mention the wine?,2
"Plus, on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited!",1
It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.,1
Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.,0
Love Pizza 33..,1
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.,1
"I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.",1
Less = More in their case.,1
Ruby Foo's is a tourist trap.,0
I've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.,0
I've been many time and have never been disappointed.,1
Ciao Bella,2
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.,0
The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.,1
"However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.",1
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.,0
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.,1
"Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.",1
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!,0
"After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.",1
Taj Mahal offeres great value and great food.,1
Has the chef and owner changed???,2
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience.,1
I absolutely Loved this place.,1
I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible!,1
"But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.",0
"Outstanding Bagels, but you get what you pay for.",1
"Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!",1
"If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.",0
I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one.,1
"I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.",1
They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food!,2
"Service was warm and attentive, beef carpaachio was exellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared.",1
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together.,2
"Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).",1
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.,1
Located at the end of a magnificent block.,1
"This restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least.",0
"Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.",1
Keep up the good work guys!,1
Hurley's is terrific!,1
They don't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum.,2
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening.,2
"Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).",1
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.,0
Really really bad,0
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.,1
Our friends have not arrived yet.,2
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.,0
"I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.",1
"The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!",2
"My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.",1
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.,1
"The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.",1
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish.,1
"I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.",1
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.,1
The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.,1
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or lines.,0
Pizza here is consistently good.,1
We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.,1
"After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.",0
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!,0
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.,0
My husband and I enjoy Sangria.,2
"But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.",1
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.,1
"First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...",0
"Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!",1
"In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.",1
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.,1
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.,0
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.,2
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.,1
Other apetizers and food,2
The noodle and rices dishes taste great.,1
The food's as good as ever.,1
"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.",1
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!,1
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.,0
"the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.",0
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.,1
The sauces used are also not that exciting.,0
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.,1
I absolutely love this place!!!,1
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.,0
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!,1
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.,1
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.,0
"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",1
"I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.",1
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.,1
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.,0
"If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!",1
No thanks!!!,2
"There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.",2
I would definently recommend this restaurant.,1
The prices are wonderfully low.,1
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.,1
I lOVE THIS PLACE!,1
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials.,1
"So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.",1
"A big disappointment, all around.",0
And its absolutely DELICIOUS.,1
No free drink.,0
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.,1
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.,1
Definitely Highly NOT recommended.,0
"While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.",1
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.,1
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.,2
Don't waste money on decor.,0
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?,1
"go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!",1
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.,1
"Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.",0
I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.,2
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.,2
"While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.",2
I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.,1
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.,1
"Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender!",1
I pray it stays open forever.,1
"Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.",1
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.,1
"If you want to save some money, don't go here.",0
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.,1
"I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).",1
"It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service.",0
This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right.,0
You should pass on the calamari.,2
"The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.",0
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.,1
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE.,1
The fries are yummy.,1
"Friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service.",1
Best Taiwanese food in NY!,1
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.,0
This place is a great stop for great food.,1
All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City.,1
What for?,2
Fantastic!,1
"they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.",0
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date.,1
"We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, I feel.",1
And the prices were way to high for what you get.,0
"But people from Sichuan will die for it)  - Chongqing Hot Pot, chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan, now became an independent province.",1
"Skip Baroanda down the street (Eurotrashy, snooty and expensive) and check this place out!",0
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.,0
The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there.,0
"Yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.",0
"I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.",1
"The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.",1
"I need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!",0
Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment.,0
"All of it was simply amazing, unique and tasty and best of all it didn't break the bank.",1
"Great wine list, reasonably priced.",1
The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale.,0
"While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either).",2
Beef noodle soup is good as well.,1
I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got!,0
Delivery service is great too.,1
"The food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.",1
I recieved prompt service with a smile.,1
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT's.,1
The place was quiet and delightful.,1
Impeccable service,1
.the best I've found outside of the Chinatown masters.,1
They are amazing!,1
Avoid this place!,0
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.,1
A must try!,1
"As much as I like the food there, I can't bring myself to go back.",2
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.,0
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.,1
The soup is pretty good too.,1
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.,1
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.,1
"If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!",1
"Based on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed.",0
Went here on a friend's reccomendation.,1
"not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .",0
"I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.",1
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh.,1
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!,0
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.,1
"Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.",1
"On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.",1
We will definitely go back.,1
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.,2
Is just the way it was in days gone by.,2
"If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC.",0
The food is amazing!!!!,1
"Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.",2
"The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.",2
"For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.",1
"The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!",1
The atmosphere is great!!!,1
"It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.",1
"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.",0
"I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.",1
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.,1
"The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.",2
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.,1
"The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .",2
The pickles were great addition.,1
"If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.",0
You must try the shrimp appetizers.,1
"Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming.",1
"Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.",0
"The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part.",1
"Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.",0
"my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldn't miss roxy,s food is expensive but it's new york!",2
"It's like you are transported to the Italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques.",1
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.,1
Just go and see for yourself.,2
"The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.",2
"Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.",1
I hate this.,0
Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.,1
"Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.",1
That place was awesome!,1
The food at this place is 'gourmet' Indian cuisine.,1
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!,1
"Even though the service is top class, the ambiance is below average",2
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'.,0
"However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.",1
"While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, Katz's has a charm about it.",1
"However, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked PERFECT",1
Priced at upper intermediate range.,0
"The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.",2
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight.,2
"If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.",0
Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.,1
"While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.",1
So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.,0
It's very spicy but not offensive.,2
"they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.",1
I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.,0
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.,1
They used shredded cheese on top!,2
They are located in the middle of Chinatown!,2
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.,1
Eating at Ottimo is like eating in heaven,1
Katz's deli is a great experience.,1
Check it out.,2
"The only positive was the wait staff, which was prompt, knowledgable, and likeable.",1
I couldn't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher.,1
"I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.",1
I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine!!!,1
i would go again if i didn't have to pay.,1
"For the location, the prices are very reasonable.",1
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.,2
My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).,2
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime.,0
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I don't have to rush off to a show.,1

"Hopefully next time, I will save room for dessert.",1
"Alain Ducasse is the best of everything, I mean everything was excellent",1

The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth.,1
GO HERE.,1
"The best Chicken pad tai, I've ever had.",1
We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.,0
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.,1
It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .,1
Over 100 different choices to create your own.,1
"Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service.",1
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.,1
"Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience.",1
We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?,1
"I almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself!",1

I loved it and will be back soon.,1
"Always a nice crowd, but never loud.",1

"The service is spotty, sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there.",2
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend.,1

"My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,",1
"Try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret!",1
"Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.",0
"uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater eel) to get a good taste comparison.",1
"We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.",1
"The crispy chicken wasn't for us, though.",0
JUST AWESOME.,1
Food is great.,1
There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.,1
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!,1
This place is incredibly tiny.,2
"I will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!",1
"I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.",1
This is one of our all-time favorite.,1
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.,1
"The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.",1
"But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.",1
this place is amazingly bad.,0
"Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.",1
I've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.,0
I love this place.,1
"The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.",1
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.,1
"It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.",2
Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time.,1
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.,0
"The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.",0
The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.,0
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.,1
The fried rice is really good too.,1
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.,1
Made my dining experience uncomfortable.,0
It's a steal!,1
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments.,2
"still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and another were serves eventhough they were there much longer...",0
I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.,1
"A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.",1
"THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.",1
What's the difference between the two?,2
Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!,0
"Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.",1
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.,0
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.,1
We also had shared a house salad that was fresh.,1
The ceiling is amazing!,1
My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary.,1
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.,1
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.,0
Not a small feat for good french food in the area.,1
"The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.",0
Food was average but tasty.,2
We came from New Jersey to eat the burger,1
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.,1
Will never be back.,0
"The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.",0
I highly recommend it.,1
Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.,0
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.,1
"With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.",2
"The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.",0
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.,1
"my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).",1
"Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown.",1
"Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.",1
My six year old loved it.,1
Pizza was a little soggy.,0
"The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.",1
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever.,0
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.,0
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.,1
there was dirt on top of the cans of soda,0
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.,0
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.,1
Definite go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad.,1
"THE ATMOSHPHERE IS COMPACT, MODERN, YET COZY.",1
"By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.",1
"Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.",0
"Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware.",2
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.,0
"The food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared.",1
"Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.",0
Too cold to enjoy.,0
"NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.",0
Try the dish made of sea bass.,1
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.,1
I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it.,1
"Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.",2
Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.,0
"During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.",1
"But they don't have a toaster, which is strange.",0
"So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.",2
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.,0
A must for all the Dosa lovers.,1
"The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.",1
The appetizers are just OK ,2
the main courses were decidedly subpar.,0
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.,0
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.,1
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table.,1

It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef.,0
"Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.",1
"It was nice and fresh, but I can't give it high scores on being authentic thai.",2
"Overall, worth every penny.",1
"When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.",1
"Got club soda, filled with ice, no lime.",0
"Only wine and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.",1
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.,2
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.,1
I haven't been to the other locations.,2
"Oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!",1
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.,2
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap.,1
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average.,0
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.,2
Decent wine selection too.,2
Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.,1
"It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.",1
I have to say I have never had such a disappointing meal here.,0
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.,1

Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).,1
"Disappointing food, lousy service.",0
"I'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant I recommend going.",1
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street.,1
"If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service, this is the place.",1
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.,1
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they're doing.,1
"Over price, and small portions .",0
"Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.",1
But I'd go back,1
the waiter Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.,0
The food was well prepared and the service impecable.,1
"BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.",1
"Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch.",1
"My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.",1
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.,0
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai (another delicious Thai restaurant).,1
"Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.",1
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.,1
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.,1
Perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda.,1
"That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.",1
Everything about this restaurant was special.,1
"Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.",1
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.,2
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.,1
While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous.,2
It is expensive but well worth the money.,1
Service is not what one would have expected ,0
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.,1
i would recommend reservations on weekends though.,1
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is at the top.,1
Great pizza for lunch place.,1
The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.,2
I don't think I would go again.,0
We were a group of 8 and well seved.,1
And that's no mean feat...,0
I often go there to eat with my family.,1
I wish they would change back to what it was before.,0
"The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.",2
NO PIZZA 33 for me!,0

I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time.,2
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple.,2
The staff is also attentive and friendly.,1
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.,1
"That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.",0
"This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street.",1
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.,0
first it took us a long time to find the place.,0
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!,1
"It is about FOOD and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine.",0
The food was good too.,1
"We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.",1
"Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.",0
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!,1
"Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.",1
I am a die hard peep lover.,1
"Once you become a regular, you are treated as one.",1
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.,1
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family.,1
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.,1
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats.,2
The menu is nothing like the one on the website.,0

sometimes i get good food and ok service.,2

The food was spicy and delicious.,1
I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening.,2
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.,1
It was wonderful.,1

Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar.,0
"Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.",0
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet.,2
"Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.",2
You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.,1
This was my frist time at Cafe and I must say how delicious the food and the service was.,1
I don't get it either.,0
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.,2
Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.,1
"It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).",0
"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.",0
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.,1
"They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.",0

Stay far away from this place.,0
We will come back!!!,1
We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.,1

This food is asian-air fusion.,2
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.,1

"While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so proudly in the window.",2
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning.,1
"But on a lazy Saturday night, we ended up going.",2
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.,1

Once for dinner and once for brunch.,2
"I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.",1

Every course was better than the next.,1

"Spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet.",1
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.,1

We got something that we did not order,0
Worth a visit.,1
A real dissapointment.,0

Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished.,1

The food overcompensated the flaws,1
"Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.",1
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour).,1

"Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull.",0
The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened.,2
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.,1
"Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.",1
"Service was excellent, and the AC worked very well too (thank God, it was hot!).",1

The service was ok.,2
"When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.",0
I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!,1

After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.,0
This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.,1

We would return to this place again!,1
Not enough wines by the glass either.,0
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.,1

This is probably one of my new favorite places.,1
"For being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.",0
"For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion, I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants.",2

The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.,1

You have to increase the service a lot.,0
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.,0
"I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.",1
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.,0
"After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!",0
"After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!",0

This is a fun restaurant to go to.,1
"The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.",0
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.,1

A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?,0
but still my date was bad,0
Would definitely go back again.,1
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.,1
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.,2
(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.,1
"Sure, the setting is nice.",1
Overall a worthwhile experience.,1
"The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.",1

THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!,1
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!,1
Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.,1
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.,0
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.,1
"And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).",1
"Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.",0
I had a great experience.,1
"The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.",0
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.,1
The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.,1
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.,0

Go for it!,1
Highly recommended.,1
"You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.",1
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.,0
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.,0
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.,0
"To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.",1
"The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.",0
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.,2
"Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.",2

We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.,1

"The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.",2
"The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.",1
"I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is just that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!",0
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.,0
But $1 for each small piece???,0
"Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.",1
big and soft as well as good lunch food.,1

I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.,1
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.,1
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.,1
Not a great place for family or general dining.,0
"As for the bar, this is another bad idea.",0
"Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.",0
"Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.",0
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.,0
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.,1
What generous portions!,1
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).,0
I was wrong.,2
The wine the service was very good too.,1
"So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.",1
The highly spiced chai tea was great too.,1
No plans to return anytime soon.,0
"I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.",1

There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.,1
"While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.",2
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.,1
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.,0
The meat dishes were only so-so.,0
"His wife Tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious.",1
"We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.",1
"The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.",1
"I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.",1
"But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.",1
For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.,0
And you're hungry a few hours later.,0
I can't wait to go back.,1
I HATE HATE HATE this place.,0
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.,1
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.,1
"You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.",2
"The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.",0
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.,1
Wonderful!,1
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.,0
The service is descent even when this small place is packed.,1
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.,1
Go hungry and enjoy.,1
I have eaten a lot of pizza here.,1
This place is worth an one-hour drive.,1
Great value for the quality ingredients.,1
"The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.",0
The sushi is also great!,1
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.,1
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.,1
"The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.",2
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.,1
"The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.",1
The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.,0
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.,0
All I can say is WOW!,1
"though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.",1
"The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.",2
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.,2
The lox is always fresh too.,1
"Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.",2
Service was very friendly.,1
So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I've ever been to.,1
Food was OK - fish was cooked well.,1
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.,0
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.,1
"The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.",0
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.,0
"I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.",0
The staff offers impeccable service.,1
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!,1
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.,1
wont come back again for sure!,0
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.,0

"The place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.",1
"I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.",1
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.,1
"After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.",0
And the bill was outragous.,0
"The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.",1
"Kind, attentive wait staff.",1
Bon appettite!!,1
Salads were fantastic.,1
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.,1

The food is authentic Italian - delicious!,1
"A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.",1
skip dessert.,0
We spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed.,0
It is simply amazing.,1
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.,0
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.,1
I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return.,0
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.,1
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.,1

This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced.,1
"Bravo, Blue Hill!",1
"Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.",1
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village.,1
"Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the service.",0
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.,0
This place is to be avoided.,0
"Stick to dimsum, not super overpriced noodles.",0
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view.,1
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.,0
"We were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.",0
"At 6:30, we were the third party there.",0
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.,1

Try sushimi cucumber roll.,1
I'm saving up for my next visit.,1
The food is delicious.,1
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $30.,1
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.,1
Amma is nothing special.,0
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.,0
"believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.",0
"Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!",1

Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.,1

"Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.",0
"I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.",2
We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.,0
Beautiful experience.,1
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC.,1
"If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.",1
Decor leaves something to be desired.,1
Jimmy is Dominican!,0
"Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.",1
"Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.",1

My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.,1
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.,0

This is also where I was from.,1
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.,0
"Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.",2
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.,1
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.,0
Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.,1
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris.,0
I have never had anything like it!,1

"The staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb.",1
"I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them.",1

Too bad Latin Quarters closed.,0
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL.,0
It was divine melts in your mouth.,1

The counter service is bad.,0

I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.,0
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.,1
None of that yucky whipped stuff.,1

"As far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.",2

"Southern Indian cuisine is still there, too.",2
"Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.",0
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.,1
They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.,0
For two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.,1
Killer Sushi!,1
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious!,1
"Staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all.",2
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.,1
And I've been to many NYC delis.,0
This place is always packed.,1
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.,0
Plus they made a perfect martini.,1
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch.,0

"All in all a wonderful experience, can't wait to come back.",1
The food was actually aweful.,0
"after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now, its official !",1
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch.,1

We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!,1
"My husband and I both ordered the Steak, medium.",2

This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.,1
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but.,0
"My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach, the Shanghai low mein, and other attractions.",1
Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit.,1

And the food was fantastic.,1
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.,1

"My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.",0
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge!,1
The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's.,1
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!,1

This place is not worth the prices.,0
We left after one drink.,0
Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.,0
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.,0
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city.,1
"You are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge.",1
It's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials.,1
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.,1
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.,1
"The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.",0

"Service was slow, but the people were friendly.",2
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.,1
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.,0
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!,0
And affordable.,1

i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.,1
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry).,2

I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores.,0
The bagel was huge.,1
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.,1
Get the tuna of gari.,0

"Yeah, sometimes the service can be slow.",2
There was no ambiance.,0
"Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing food and the BEST service.",1
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura.,1
But trust me it is so worth it.,1
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge.,0
THe perfect spot.,1
"The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.",0

No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.,0
Indoor was very cozy and cute.,1
We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.,1
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service!,0
They're terrific!!,1
"The service was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.",1
The service is good and the resturant is clean.,1

"Good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).",1
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.,1

keep up the good work.,1

It was wonderful.,1
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.,0
Will give it another chance before I write it off.,2
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.,1
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.,1
The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber.,1

"The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.",1
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.,1

Decor is charming.,1
The food was very well prepared.,1
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though.,1
Stay away from this place.,0
"Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.",2
"While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.",1
"Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.",1

I go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.,1
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty.,1
Horrible food and Horrible service.,0
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling.,1
Bleecker St Pizza is the best!,1
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY.,0
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared.,1
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.,1

They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent.,1
I've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait.,1
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.,2

Not good at all....................................,0
"I went to Bailey road branch. The pizza is so poor i felt it was just robbery. The cheese was very thin and the bread was thin too. The topping was also very low in quantity. It felt like , i am having a ruti with some vaji :p The behaviour was good though and that's why i am giving 2 star. Never going to try again unless the food quality improves.",0
"Today we had the most awful experience at BbQ Dhanmondi branch. They have been offering the 50% discount on beverage and i liked their frappe everytime so went their tonight as it was the last night. And even though we had called at their number and verified that the store was open they denied to serve us the frappes! Not ony that, after providing us the menue the waiter was taking a while to come back. I found that the waiter and the manager was solving a dispute with ano...ther client. So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!! Even though we had said we didn't want anything else at all that being an International Chain they should be serving us they denied us completely!! I should also mention we went to the Dhanmondi branch just this friday night and the pizza was terrible too!!! It was nothing like the Gulshan branch pizza. Really really disappointed by this ignorant attitude and i doubt i will ever go back.",0
Good environment with good food. I m loving it. Go ahead,1
"Good food, friendly service -- what more to expect!",1
I ma very very disappointed with this food center ... i ordered a Burger and Lemon Soda...

Rating 4/10 Service was below poor but they charged 5% serving charge. The man who took our order was talking like a broker in a korbanir hat. Kabab served after a long long time. Taste : Average Price : Too much.,0

"Ordered soft and juicy burger , it isn't worth rating 10/10,9/10 , either overcooked or not much warm (I ordered via pathao food so it could be their fault that they waited too much so it's getting cold) but still I can rate them 6/10 , now come to chocolate cold coffee, I wish I will never drink such tasteless thing, as I was drinking sugar syrup with some ice cube that not even melted 0/10, my third item was french fries for which I can rate their overall 2 star. This came perfectly and taste rate be 8/10. Unexpected much.",0
"Don't know why the taste of soft & juicy burger is decreasing day by day. Now they use less sauce and there is something missing in chicken also. Really missed the previous taste of this burger. After opening the Jatrabari outlet, bashabo is.......!!!",0
"simply waste of money.i tried their burgers several time just because of some of my friends recommended me to give them treat there that's because this is located in my neighborhood, but each time they dissatisfied me ï¿½",0
I got upset,0
not impressed with the deco and chair . Steak is average. Parking was a nightmare .,0
Too much disappointing..,0
Total waste,0
"The white cream pasta is too sweet. Feels like a garbage sweet pitha. The burgers are not well formed and french fries are not crispy and hot. The coleslaw was too sweet too. Dont get me wrong, I love sweet but these are not deserts. I recommend not to go here to waste money and time. The sitting arrangements are good by the way. Oh they also have a coupleâ€™s place for make out and stuffs. If you want to try it in case.",0
3rd class behavior!!!,0
Disgusting behaviour!!!,0
"It was not food actually, it was a punishment for me. Grow up. People prefer tasty food more than your interior.",0

"To me the overall experience was not that good, specially the ambience of the restaurant is not up to the mark.",0
Overpriced. Quality of the food and the amount did not meet expectation. Would not recommend.,0
Went there on February this year. Absolute shit. Deserves 0 star. The tempura was served cold. The soya sauce was overpowering. The sushi tasted bland and few days old. Horrible. Expected a lot,0
The teriyaki chicken was too salty !,0
Tempura served cold(without salt) Wasabi soyas were overpowering Sushis were also bland,0
They have no idea about the measurement of Salt.,0

A beautiful place to dine in.The interiors take you back to the Mughal era. he soya chaap was a standout dish. Clearly one of trademark dish as per me and a must try,1
Had been here for dinner with family. Turned out to be a good choose suitable for all ages of people. Prices are affordable. Will recommend this restaurant for early dinner. The place is little noisy.,1
Ambience is not that good enough and it's not a pocket friendly cafe and the quantity is not that good and desserts are too good enough ??That'll be my last visit San Churros.,0
Great food and proper Karnataka style full meals. Been there twice and was fully satisfied.. Will give 5 stars if it's well managed,1
Very good restaurant in neighbourhood. Buffet system is properly arranged. Variety of dishes along with garba dance and puppet show. Good spread of desserts.,1
Had been here for family lunch.Food was OKAY. But the service is too slow. They will make you wait for 20 mins to get the order. This place is apt for family hangout.,2
Awesome food ??Great serviceFriendly staffsGood quality of food Complimentary Breakfast. Good Food quality. Like to visit again. . Also outdoor dining is available.,1

"I had been to this place with one of my friends, it's a very small place but decent. And nice place to hangout. The service was slow. they have no beverages on that particular day to serve",2
We ended up here on a Saturday afternoon after an hectic day\nThe food was too good\nThe ambience is okay.The food was amazing but they might need to work on the pizza and the crepes.,2
Horrible. Not even kidding. They gave undercooked chicken wings and the sauce on it was not even BBQ sauce. It was some local sauce with little spices in it. Pizza hardly had toppings on it. Staffs were so irresponsible.,0
"Easily the best cafPeaceful for business talks or studies.Recommended for any meal, peaceful and in budget food.",1
This is a hookah cafe. It was not mentioned anywhere in the page that it was a hookah place. There's also no separate seating for non smokers. Horrible ambience. Ppl including waiters smoking hookah everywhere. I'm never gonna visit this place again.,0

"Not so good place as I was expecting from here. The ambience is quite ok but the food is not good at all and very slow service. There were only two people in the outlet to serve the customers, not satisfied upto the mark",0
You will be tired by the time you reach unless you are a fitness freak.A cool place to hangout when your girl is getting a hair treatment in perimeter salon..\nNevertheless it was okay I hope they would improve their ambience and service.,2
"New place.. though it's a biryani place,I tried Chinese food. Best thing is the quantity, too good for the price. Food was kind of ok,not great. Definitely worth the price. A slight improvement with the taste will make the place a favourite",2
Happy to see such a cafe nearby to our house. This cafe is run by a couple and their family. They're really very polite and friendly. The prices are very reasonable and I recommend this place for people who like to spend time with their friends,1
"Friendly staffs , nice ambience colourful lights , hanging skeletons reasonable price , nice music gud for group of friends enjoyed a lot ??????",1
This outlet is better than other outlets. But the service was slow. Ambience was good. The garlic bread was not that great. But the other dishes were yum.,2
"So, went here with friends for tea. The ambience is striking to say the least.. They have a umpteen varieties of teas from basic chai and lemon tea to variants like saffron and cranberry. You name it, they have it. They also have some food to go with it",1

"0Worst restaurant ever ,Horrible service. I ordered veg noodles and got egg. And as our campus restricts non vegetarian food beyond a time, I was forced to throw the food away. When I tried telling this to the restaurant representatives, they responded in the most arrogant fashion ever, talking in their own slang and asking me how can there exist such a hostel which does that. Finally they say they will not give a refund or the corrected order because they would incur a loss. Not one care was given to the fact that they tried to serve egg to a vegetarian.",0

"Food was ok but they robbed me by including items in the bill which I have not ordered and did not receive; I went to the cashier and before paying I have told him that I have not ordered this but he says its been billed and he is ""feeling dukkhito"" for this. I had an argument with the manager and was expecting something complimentary but he was also ""feeling dukkhito"" and said will consider me with good service next time as if I am a beggar to beg them for money or anything. I told them you all stole money and that's wrong and I don't live abroad so it does not matter whatever you do next time. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THEM AND WILL NEVER COME BACK WHEN I AM IN BANGALDESH.",0
Dhanmondi branch has the worst quality of food and the worst food quality of customer service. I have never been through such a horrible experience before. And that horrible experience incurred at a very high price. Will never visit again.,0
Food was over priced and not up to the mark in taste! If you are going to charge that much the least you can do is to improve your cooking! The pasta was runny ?!?!???,0
Not good at all....................................,0
"Today we had the most awful experience at BbQ Dhanmondi branch. They have been offering the 50% discount on beverage and i liked their frappe everytime so went their tonight as it was the last night. And even though we had called at their number and verified that the store was open they denied to serve us the frappes! Not ony that, after providing us the menue the waiter was taking a while to come back. I found that the waiter and the manager was solving a dispute with ano...ther client. So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!! Even though we had said we didn't want anything else at all that being an International Chain they should be serving us they denied us completely!! I should also mention we went to the Dhanmondi branch just this friday night and the pizza was terrible too!!! It was nothing like the Gulshan branch pizza. Really really disappointed by this ignorant attitude and i doubt i will ever go back.",0
Soft drink 99+vat . :( It is too expensive. Others,0
"Okay, here's an honest review. Went to the Dhanmondi Branch yesterday and the food was okay. It was nothing completely out of the ordinary and that would have been completely alright had the items not been priced premium. The service was absolutely horrible! I mean how are you guys still in business with the current lot of waiters? A waiter literally tried to force an item on us by repeatedly insisting in the rudest of manners and the most annoyed of expressions. We had to ca...ll the waiters multiple times before any of them responded, every time. No, they weren't busy, just standing at the nearest tissues counter (or something) doing absolutely nothing. It took them about 15 minutes to get the bill and another 15 to return the change. The music was too loud and they did not turn down the volume even after we requested them to. Please take note that we have not been rude to any of the servers even once through out the whole process. Now, considering the fact that the Dhanmondi branch is a relatively new outlet, the cutlery items used should still be in relatively good condition but they were not. Most of the spoons had so many scratch marks on them that it almost gave the feeling that we had been provided with used utensils from the older branches. Does not reflect the class BBQ BD claims to boast. Not a good experience overall. Not sure if I wanna go back there, not anytime soon at least. P.S.- Can provide pictures if necessary.",0
"Bbq Bangladesh Dhanmondi Branch is a big disappointment, Menu card's price of each item really differs with the price of the bill,I have tried your Gulshan branch for almost 6-7times and I loved it, no complains from there.. And 2times at your dhanmondi branch.. My experience was bad both the times there.dhanmondi branch serves completely different quality of food, it's too bad , the quantity of your pane cream soup was very low.. Taste of chicken was bad and served cold. The... second time I went there, the taste of the food was average and I clearly remember that I ordered food costing around 1500 -1600tk on the menu card( Korean Charboiled chicken 3pcs chicken, 1 piece jamaican chicken meal with mashed potatoes and 3 cocacolas). They charged me the double on their bill around 3000tk. I have calculated on my own and it would have been around 1800tk-2000tk with vat and service charge. This was a clear fraud.. This might also be an inside fraud between the manager and the waiters so the authority must take this into consideration.I am never going back to bbq bangladesh again. This was not only me who faced such a problem but also I know few more people disappointed with Bbq Bangladesh dhanmondi's bill problem.",0
"Ripping people off basically. Please kindly take business seriously if not passionately. The management is very poor and the description of their items is not true to its words. Iftar platter was terrible. So are the burgers, the meat was raw inside even though said to be grilled and their was no cheddar cheese given inside the Korean char boiled burger.",0
"I had been there today for Iftar . The food was so cold,specially fried rice and salad was dry.Service person was not caring to the guest. very poor service. Management should concern about service.",0
"Food Taste and price are not smiler...those foods making cost is so cheap but they are charging high volume of price. Nothing smiler with south koriean bbq, just Branch deco and bbq logo is same like as original brand. sorry but wasn't happy with the quality..",0
I am sorry but it was the worst food experience there. Surely i wont go there ever. Peace.,0
"I ordered Golden Olive Value Meal but I cudnt find anything valuable! Whatever , this combo contains 1pc golden olive chicken ,fried cajun wedge potato, veg rice, egg n salad! At first , they forgot using salt probably :) 1) so far I know with my little knowledge, olive chicken is prepared using olive oil to fry the whole chicken n mixed up with some spices .I neither found any spice nor olive taste. 2) veg rice - hardly got vegetable, dried up rice , less quantity 3) egg ...: even an egg can taste this much worse , I didn't know , forgot using salt here also, as mentioned. 4) potato: the only thing I cud eat at least. Overall experience was worst, this dish costs 345 including Vat.I never hesitate spending if the quality and taste are satisfactory, but this place was irritating enough",0
Ordered a chicken pizza that had no crust or dough .It was just a pancake.Terrible service.Not going back again,0
Food did not taste good at all. Inside Gangjeong Chicken there was no spice. The veg fried rice was below average in terms of taste and quantity. It was a bad experience though service was good and place is nice. Price is very very high considering taste.,0
I wish I can give 0 starts...The combo pizza was worst >_<,0
Terrible food ....place is congested....price is too high...just waste of money,0
Worst food ever i had...... n dat jamaican chicken..... oh..... i dont know why people r going to hv it its just like normal chicken i could not find any taste,0
Took 45 min to serve a kids meal. Their service is so bad,0
"well, foods r not bad.....just thinking abt service makes me shudder! it could tarnish all the good development the stakeholders may have done...",0
"okay, I might be a bit late in my review but what the hell. I first went to bbq right after it opened and my friends and I ordered our individual dishes. One of my friends ordered your pasta and didnt even have a bite of it as she was too full, we told the waiters to parcel it but they told us they didnt have the equipment to do so, at that moment the rest of us we stuffed with food so couldnt even taste the pasta or take it home. At the end, we had to pay for the pasta not even eating a bite of it. It was a very disappointing experience of my point of view.",0
"Good vibe bt average food.wont go dere again.after all,y go to a restaurant to eat if da foods not tasty.",0
Came during rush hour and ordered for 5 people and the service was horrible at best. Got served with ice cold food and waited for it for at least 30 mins. Rubbish. And the managers were damn care about it. Lesson learnt never visit this place when you see lots of cars parked outside!,0
Good for only photo not for food at all. They sell pad thai noodles but in their menu it is written as mixed chawmin. It is not acceptable. At mohammadpur most of the resturent did not charge any vat but they charge vat. Service is tooo slow. Food taste is not up to the mark according to price. Not recommended at all. Set menu taste is so bad that we can't finish it.,0
#Worst_experience_ever.. This place is not as well as their pictures.. Food quality is just horrible..I ordered #Spaghetti and they provided a dish of salty and disgusting things...I was vomiting after tasting that wretched dish.. And the smell was too bad.Just in a word it was worst.. After ordering chicken fry I observed it was also salty and not worthy for eating.. And their service was so poor..I asked one of them for changing the dish but they didn't.. One of them said 'à¦†à¦®à¦¿ à¦Ÿà§‡à¦¸à§à¦Ÿ à¦•à¦°à§‡ à¦¡à¦¿à¦¸ à¦Ÿà¦¾ à¦¸à¦¾à¦°à§à¦­ à¦•à¦°à§‡à¦›à¦¿'à¥¤ How lame!!! This place is not recommended at all....,0
Food quality is not good as their price. Upgrade ur food quality first,0
It's the worst .. price is too high where amount is very less... And the taste is salt less...,0
"food quality average Pricing Ava rage, Management was bulshit policy also, Environment wast too much warmth , No AC or Fan in outdoor .",0
Worst behaviour. Worst management system. Bad experienced ever.,0
1. Dirty toilet. 2. Delay service. 3. Ignorance customer care staff,0
their place is so small & also food was not up to the mark...,0
"the worst service ever! waiters act like they don't know what they are here for, no clue of what's on the menu and the hydrabadi biriyani we took away, they didn't provide with the sides. i mean seriously!",0
Poor food quality & worst service ever. The food were rotten also musty. The waiters were so late to serve food but very fast to take the bills. After serving food they were just wandering around us like when will we finish and leave the restaurant. bloody nonsense people and cheap quality foods though price were very high!. I will never ever go there.,0
"The worst food, worst service. but the prices are high",0
worst food ever ,0
"WORST SERVICE,WORST FOOD AND PRICE IS TOO HIGH",0

"Worst place ever...since it is a common place for eve-teasers... so girls visit at your own risk because u might be harassed and the ignorant staffs will give preferences to their frequent visitors, who are jerks.",0
One Of the worst food I have ever Eat in my whole life. Better not to go there. Horrible place to eat.,0
Extremely bad chow mein. They were good before Ramadan. Their food is absolutely horrible now.,0
Aikhankar staff ra customer der harassment kore. Don't go there. And also some of the staff brings their eve teaser friends in here and those low life teasers keeps harassing the girls. Absolutely not a safe place for girls.,0
Risky place for girls as eve-teasers openly tease and employees do not utter a word. Such place should be avoided as they can not ensure safety.,0
Breeding ground for eve-teasers. Girls should steer clear from this place. Guys should also ignore such places that cannot ensure people's safety!,0
Hate this place as they support eve teaser rather than supporting the victims..girls should avoid this place must.,0
A very disgusting environment filled with creeps. The staff doesn't do anything about it. Not a safe place for women. Shit momos.,0
Girls should be careful if they visit yo momos because if u face any eve teaser there they will not come forward they will not give u any support !! Shame on yo momos,0
This place hosts potential rapists and eve teasers.,0
Creepy people harass girls inside restaurant. The concerns donâ€™t take any step. Worst ever,0
you know very well why you are getting this one star..,0
"price quite higher, service absolutely poor, delivery time just bullshit",0
I ma very very disappointed with this food center ... i ordered a Burger and Lemon Soda... Burger was okay enough but Lemon soda was way too disgusting .... simply it was just as salty saline ... i even requested them to ask if there was any mistake and to check ... but they said that's how they make Lemon Soda ... trust me i am so pissed off ... Worst Lemon Soda ever ....,0
It's unhygienic environment and very very poor customer service... Please don't go...,0
"The pizza was Fucking Horrible, How could you call that thing 'pizza'??",0
"Really disappointed with recent 499 bogo meal. You have just served one meal in a 2 plates, quantity is very low.",0
"You guys should mention about minimum order when post any advertisement through Facebook. When I called for HAKKA LUNCHBOX, you are saying that minimum order is 1000/- coz itâ€™s free delivery but both of these informations were not mentioned. Pls donâ€™t mislead your customers.",0
Took 1.5 hours to give our food,0
Worst restuarant in dhaka... .....................,0
Taste 2/10 Quantity 1/10 Price compared to food 2/10 Ambience 2/10,0
"Today I ordered some items from Hakkah Dhaka through FoodPanda and my experience was awful! They were not eatable and too oily to digest. On top of that, they were not freshly cooked. I believe they have given us the leftovers!",0
"have no freaking idea why they have decided to take part in restaurant week. on reaching, they said that they won't serve the given menu after 5.30pm. after much discussion they showed some mercy! n decided otherwise. Now for the last 50mins we are waiting like refugees for the food to come... :( :(",0
If possible I would give it a zero. The dhanmondi branch waiters are fraud. Me and my friend took two happy meal to eat and two for parcel. They gave us smelly leftover chicken i guess. They literally lied to us that two plates will get only one kulfi so they cut the kulfi into pieces and served us. For the two parcels they said they cannot give drinks or kulfi instead they would give only one yoghurt. They literally seemed like they didn't wanted to serve us..why?? Because there was no guy with us??...even after inquiring several times they just cheated us by not serving what we paid for.....such theif waiters in a restaurant like hakka dhaka seriously?? Worst behaviour and experience!!,0
Come and have food from your worst nightmare! I'd rate maggi noodles better!,0
I wish I can give negative marking.. Was my first time yesterday for iftar... But their way of serving food for iftar is very disappointing. When you fasting your food must be on your table so that you can eat/ate according your choice rather than you just wait for food for their serving. Exactly that was happen for every customer yesterday. Another thing iftar platter for 4 Person was 4000 bdt and I was asking myself why I paid for these kind of food.. The items all were spicy and hot that you couldn't differentiate the taste. And quantity of food was not anyone's desired....,0
Most disgusting food in a noisy place and full of rude waiters.,0
The worst food I ever had. I will never go there again and I suggest no one should.,0
Sue the chef...worst food ever,0
sorry to say had a bad experience...food was cold and disgusting....never going there again,0
"Except for the beef noodle, the wings and prawns were trash compared to their previous quality",0
Ordered the PLATTER-B worth of 1300 for 2 person.. And here's what i think 1) Rock-hard beef. I know it was supposed to be dry but it's definitely not supposed to be harder than my teeth. 2) The szechuan prawn supposed to have an spicy red saucy texture. But here it's full of red grease. Looks like it came out of an old truck's engine. 3) The chicken with mushroom was okay but full of onions. Onions everywhere. 4) The dough of the dumpling was crunchy and brown. It was more like shingara. 5) The noodle was greasy and over-spicy 6) And that one star is for the fried rice which was decent.,0
foods are too spicy & oily and overpriced too. some waiters have problems with their attitude.,0
"Today me and my wife went there to have iftar and taste their Hakka food. All the seats were empty at 5:30 pm,still they said all seats were booked after hearing that we were only two persons.So, it is clear that if we were more than two, then all the booked seats would have been empty....... If u can't make arrangement for couples then hang a sign mentioning that ""no couples seats available""",0
Went there yesterday.... disgusting food quality... totally money and time loss...,0

Too much spicy food.... There is only black pepper in the dishes.. I am not satisfied at all.... :/,0
Went there yesterday... ordered mega platter for 2. Except the prawn warps nd yogurt delight each nd every dish was.. over cooked..tasteless. We were really disappointed . Also about the service.. the behavior of the waiter was annoying.. not well mannered.,0
"Went to Hakka Dhaka at Banani yesterday and had to say , the service and the behavior of the man in charge was not good . Went there at noon and maybe they were busy about Iftar services , but as I with my friends went there , the man In charge acted like we are not welcome there at all . never had to experience such bad service like that in other restaurants !",0

Worst food & unnecessarily expensive with too poor quantity ,0
"Hearing all the high praise, today we booked a table at 9:15 pm and the receiver warmly confirmed the availability. Once we reached on time there was no free table and we were asked to wait. After sometime we left, till now didn't get a call. Food may be great, perhaps need to work on service.",0
"The worst food ever tasted. I've eaten Hakka cuisine in so many far eastern countries. .....this one has burnt my lips, tongue, throat and stomach.",0
Food too sweet and spicy.,0
"Food test is very bad, if that food would have been in a small restaurant no body said good words about that but as it has a fancy name that's why (may b) people say many many good words. it is the most worst food they serve, total bill was 1272 tk.",0
"Very very bad food quality and no hygiene.. there was big hair in chicken, it felt like they marinated the chicken with the hair! Yuck! ",0
"one of the worst experiences of going to a restaurant in bangladesh was yesterday - completely ruined my lunch! a juice took 20 minutes to arrive and even after the chef being told how to modify an item on the menu, the wrong food was served! things got from bad to worse and I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE AGAIN! places like this should be shut down!",0
"Didn't have a good experience at all. The foods and services are no value for money, not even half. The worst part was, we found hair in one of the chickens",0
"Shitty service! no lie.. the scheme is to rob customers off with overpriced juices and not even an option for soft drinks, on top of that water temperature is normal. Who wants to sit in a tiny area with a big group, eat some spicy food and combine it with terrible service and normal water Chicken steak was good. that's about it. Never visiting again.",0
I just hated this place and regretted why I wasted my weekend dinner by going there. The food was so spicy that none of us could even eat. When I asked the manager why the food was done spicy without asking us in Advence they have replied that their food taste like this. So if the food is like this I don't want to visit this Resturant even again.,0
I just hated this place and . The food was so spicy . I don't want to visit this Resturant even again.overpriced.....wrost service! and not even an option for soft drinks....,0
The food is too spicy. Only people who love street foods and can digest anything garbage can enjoy here. I got sick after eating their food. Not going there anymore.,0

"I have never tasted any strawberry juice or orange juice worse than that >_< The Strawberry mujoto and Fizzy Orange were the total waste of money. The only 2-3 sip from those were just punishing! However, Mr. Crab Salad was eatable. .... Not recommended if you are a food lover and value your money",0
Waited for 1 hour 30 mins for the food..they kept on saying 5 mins 5mins so later on decided to walk out,0
taste was good i must say but their price is extremely high!!!! behavior is not up to the mark. . .there were no soft drinks except their extremely pricey juice menu...service was very poor!!!!!,0
Previously I Gave 5 Star Rating And Recommend All My Friends This Place. But Today i Went There For Hang Out. Food was Completely Disgusting. I Ordered Beef Bento & The Steak Was Fully Spicy Not Properly Cooked. Mash Potato Was Not Properly Blended. and Don't Want To Talk About The Rest Of The Food. This Restaurant Used To Be Awesome But Somehow They Let Their Customer Down. I Never Coming Back And Don't Recommend Anyone Anymore To Ruin Their Evening.,0
"Though the ambience of the restaurant was good but the food which matters the most let the restaurant down. I had the beef bento. The steak was over cooked, mashed potato was horrible (which almost made me puke) and I didn't like the mushroom as well. To me the buffalo wings lacked flavours. The only good things in the platter were the prawns and the salad. Again I had their pineapple juice which was way too grainy. They really needs to improve.",0
"This is regarding dining experience at Tree House last night(18th September 2015).I am disappointed that I could not see through the reviews before agreeing to go for dinner with friends and a one year four month old.We waited one and half hours for 3 chicken steak meals and 1 beef steak meal(there was just three options to choose from).I personally feel pricing should include the 'experience' and interior for dining out,if that is so,the pricing is high because the place is ...really really really congested.There was this loud group of boys celebrating a birthday or something,but as common sense is most uncommon these days,the small space did not affect them to share incidents about their lives as loudly as possible.The staff maybe well behaved but the waiting time for food was so dispiriting(food was served as soon as we got up to leave) that there are no pictures to share.Also, if the food was extremely exciting that would have been a totally different story.Anyway,maybe it was a bad day for me or maybe my expectations do not match the common good reviews about this place,I will never frequent this place again.",0
Food was ok but their way of handling bill isn't very responsible.,0
Horrible customer service stupidest one ever never coming back,0

"Seeing the location felt good about the cafe but they were renovating so very few customers which is why asked if they will be able to serve and the staff replied yes. To our surprise they served old and smelly chicken in their BBQ set menu to both of my colleagues and burnt mushroom to me one by one with serving the third meal 40 mind after ordering. Upon complaining they discounted 37 or 47 taka from the bill silently, which only shows they knew what they were serving and still went along with it. Very disappointing. Won't visit again and will suggest my Peers to do the same.",0
Very bad behavior. We asked for a mineral water and they gave us a local brand (ps:never heard of that company) . The cap was broken and expire date was removed. But they claimed that we broke the cap. We returned the water bottle. Then they immediately gave us the bill. We didn't even ask for the bill.,0

By far The best Chinese in town. Food is excellent and so is the ambience & service. No wonder why the elites and diplomats living around patronise it so highly both at lunch and dinner. However prices of items in recent months have been jacked up. But then in a premium eatery one has to pay premium rates I guess.,1
"The food is awesome, the inside atmosphere is excellent and very elegant interior with the combination of glass, light and nature makes us comfortable during eating.",1

"Best place ever, food was excellent, well trained staffs and also reasonable price :-D",1

Sushi and maki roles are not the only greqt Japanese food available in the market now.,1

Great experience with â€œKung Fu Panda Restaurant.â€ we had a large spicy chicken pizza just an hour ago. The delivery took place In 20min which was really amazing and the â€œpizzaâ€. I would say one of the best we had so far. Really appreciated.ï¿½ï¿½. The food and service and would recommend others to join and try. Thanks â€œKung Fu Panda Restaurantâ€,1
"The spicy chicken pizza is very delicious. I tried 12"" as well as 9"". The flavours are well balanced. the mushrooms and capsicum is not too over done. The amount of mozzarella is just perfect!",1
"Food so delicious & there environment , decoration we are like it.but one problem has we found price so much high.",1
I checked in here 2days ago and tried their special pasta. Really it's taste was good and delicious too... I liked it...lastly its interior is just beautiful so I loved it,1
Loved the place...we ordered the kung fu panda special piza & drinks...Piza was just WOW & we both apprised for that...love to go again,1
"Desperately waiting for opening. Decoration is too good to see and i hope the quality of food will also very good, probably the awaited restaurant will open very soon.",1
The food was good so was the place but the waiters are just so weird.,2
it taste is really good. I like it and love it. nice.,2
Their service was very good.But they should improve their pizza taste..There's no special taste on their pizzas.. They put very less chess on pizza..so they should think about the taste..,2
Not a good pizza place.... But their behavior is good.,2
it's flavor not so good but not bad.................,2
I had been there twice very nice experiance indeed.,2
"Love their baked pizzas, its reasonable and oven fresh than other places, only didnt like the fact that they havent improvise their washroom facility, which is limited due to their space. Hope they will work on expanding the space to improvise facilities.",2
Cooper's is always good.....but somehow the delivered a burnt cake on my sons' birthday last year and the red angry bird was PINK!,2
Why on Earth was Chittagong's one closed down? -_- Are you people insane,2
"Went there for the iftar buffet. Was decent enough. I liked the maki, red velvet and mahlabia. Rest were rather mediocre. Had the buy1 get 3 offer so it was okay for the money. But its not worth it to pay the full price.",2
"Not the best value for money. Considering the cost and the variety of food provided, it is below satisfactory.",2
Very cozy and food not that delicious as expected,2
Need to improve food quality & taste...,2
According to my daughter Space at Eatery Restaurant was less compared to Le Meridien. No nuts were available. Continental foods were tasty. Live station needs improvement.,2
Four Points by Sheraton Dhaka is swept. not better from Le-meriden. it's no courtyard. it's not better for me I ween.,2
"Starter, salad, main course was very good. But dessert area has scop of development. Local desserts are fine but international desserts tests needs to be improved.",2
The restaurant is a bit bellow rated . Verity of food was limited. Dining was not that spacious and they offers only plain water in their buffet. Only a few Deserts. However I liked their seafood verity.,2
Nice place to stay. You will have good experience at the service of them.,2
Their complimentary beverages services need to be improved.,0
The environment at the lobby is pretty good.However why does the building shakes so much at the 26th floor? It felt like a massive earthquake.,2
It was awesome. I wanna go their again. wish all the best,1
Its a beautiful restaurant good food and good view,1
"quantity was there .. but lacked quality somewhat. nothing spectacular or exceptional to make it a stand apart experience. it was nice of them to include the juice bar with the buffet & service was upto the mark too. quality of beef being served can be improved, i found it bit hard to chew. desserts section was unimaginative .. lots of different types of cupcakes .. again nothing exceptional was noted.. lacked chocolate based items or any mousse & yogurts were missing too. BIGGEST DRAWBACK WAS SERVICE STOPPING AT 3:30 pm. In context of Bangladesh, it should have been minimum 4:00 pm. & a closeby smoking section would be nice. having 2 change lifts to get to their rooftop smoking area wasn't fun.",2
"Tried buffet , average , a bit frustrating as majority items are not tasty. Good part availability of juices in buffet . Our expectation is higher , hope to see you like that , Good Luck:)",2
"Suitable location, awesome night view!!Service not up to the mark. Food average, dessert below standard..",2
Ambiance & decor is good. The staff service was good. Food was average. Coffee was like being in a canoe - so close to water !!! However what peeved me was the staff trying to speak in English with an accent. The management and staff should know that there is no shame in speaking in Bangla to the Deshi customers. Will I be back? Probably - if someone treats me...,2
The place looked amazing but if there were more food items it would've been better:),2
"They are just at preliminary stage, but I believe soon there will be some big improvement",2
Food we ordered was good... But customer service very poor,2
I really liked ur food... it was yummy. Environment was also good... obviously i must go there again,1
"It's alright to serve food slowly, it's also alright to not be able to tend to the customers very attentively on a busy day. But members of the staff should try harder to help guest select items. I had a great meal but Dad enjoyed his less, because he wasn't advised well while ordering. On the other hand, the food is great, but there is room for improvement.",2
The service was extremely slow yet with good food. thats why giving them 3/5,2
Good.... But fried rice was not up to the mark... Fish items were excellent,2
Fish & co is better & food quantity also good in fish & Co ovarelly Fish & co expensive but good.,2
I really enjoyed the food here but I was disappointed with the calamari. Half of the bowl (which was quite small in itself) was filled with fried vegetables so we basically we literally got about 6/7 pieces o calamari for a price of around 300tk. Flavour wise everything was amazing,2
Food was good.....but interior wasn't up to the mark...work on the interior,2
Their service is so bad... yesterday we ordered a pizza..and had to wait for one hour.not only this they served cold pizza also ...worst experience. ï¿½,0
"Service - not good (we had to wait 25~30 min for our order and 15 for our bill ) Food - Good (Pizza BBQ & 4 Season, Liked the crust) Environment - Good ( we had a good time)",2
so so okay,2
good,1
We have arranged a special meeting and found that all system are very remarkable and fine. Actually the place is not bad. We wish Vojon restaurant's future upgaradation and success all time.,2
 I am very disappointed ,0
I visited here 2 or 3 times ! Foods and services are good in quality ! And I liked it ! So keep it up :),1
 The food quality was not so bad. Environment was good. I would like to say that any one can go there as well as take your desirable food from there. Hopefully you will get good experience.,2
Well food and I enjoy it. Nice arrangement.I think rice cooking can be more better.,2
Great food.. Great service... And the prices are absolutely perfect.... Loved it !!!!!!,1
We ordered an achari and some usuals....there food is 2 out of 3.....there decoration is 1 out of 1.......and there service is 0 out of 1......its 3 and it's so so,2
 make faster service!,0
good food it was awesome I just like it.this food was really good,1
"food is really great test, hope we visit again soon & good place to hang out with fnf!! Happy to be here..",2
food is awesome....but delivery time is too long,2
Good taste! Specially kebabs,1
Environment is good.. sitting arrangement should be increased.. Food quality is better for some items.. but the taste of Kebab Burger was below the expectations.. Overall its okay..,2
 Please try to improve food quality :),0
I went with my frnd in utttara outlet environment was good but foood wasnt that much good,2
The kebab and icecream are good. Burger should have been bigger in portion size. ,2
Wow... Loved this place.,1
Crust is not good.,0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.,1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.),0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0
The fries were great too.,1
A great touch.,1
Service was very prompt.,1
Would not go back.,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!",1
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.,0
Highly recommended.,1
Waitress was a little slow in service.,0
"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.",0
did not like at all.,0
The Burrittos Blah!,0
"The food, amazing.",1
Service is also cute.,1
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.,1
So they performed.,1
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.,1
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.",1
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.",0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.,0
"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.",1
This was like the final blow!,0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.,1
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",0
"Overall, I like this place a lot.",1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.,1
Ample portions and good prices.,1
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.",0
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,1
Service sucks.,0
The shrimp tender and moist.,1
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.,0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0
"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.",1
"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.",0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,1
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,0
"The burger is good beef, cooked just right.",1
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!,1
"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.",1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.,1
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.,1
Their chow mein is so good!,1
"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.",0
The portion was huge!,1
"Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.",1
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.,0
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.",1
"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.",0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.,0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!,1
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.,1
We'd definitely go back here again.,1
We are so glad we found this place.,1
"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.",1
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,1
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,1
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,0
A great way to finish a great.,1
"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.",1
The service was horrible,0
"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.",0
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.",0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !,0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.,1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.,1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.,0
This place has it!,1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,1
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!,1
Omelets are to die for!,1
Everything was fresh and delicious!,1
"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.",0
"It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.",1
"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!",0
Best breakfast buffet!!!,1

"Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.",1
"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.",1
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.,1
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!,1
"The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!",1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.,1
Will go back next trip out.,1
Sooooo good!!,1
"REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.",0
"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.",0
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.,1
"Nice, spicy and tender.",1
Good prices.,1
Check it out.,1
It was pretty gross!,0
I've had better atmosphere.,0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.,0
"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.",0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.,0
"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.",0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.,1
"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.",1
"We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.",1
"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!",0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...,0
"Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.",1
I wouldn't return.,0
"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.",1
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.,0
Penne vodka excellent!,1
"They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.",1
The management is rude.,0
"Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.",1
"Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.",1
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.,1
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.,1
"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.",0
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.,1
Don't do it!!!!,0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.,1
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.,1
"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.",0
"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.",0
I give it 2 thumbs down,0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.,0
My fiancÃ© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.,1
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.,1
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.,0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.,0
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!,1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.,1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.,1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.,1
this place is good.,1
"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.",0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.,0
I was seated immediately.,1
"Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.",1
Avoid at all cost!,0
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.,1
DELICIOUS!!,1
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.,1
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...,0
I've never been treated so bad.,0
Bacon is hella salty.,1
"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.",0
"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.",1
The waitresses are very friendly.,1
"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!",1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.,1
"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.",0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.,0
"The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.",1
"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.",1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,0
"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.",0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,0
It was probably dirt.,0
"Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.",1
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.,1
"The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.",0
Interesting decor.,1
What I really like there is the crepe station.,1
"Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.",1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!),1
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.,1
"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.",0
"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.",1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.,0
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!,1
The live music on Fridays totally blows.,0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.,0
Very friendly staff.,1
It is worth the drive.,1
"I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.",1
Food was great and so was the serivce!,1
The warm beer didn't help.,0
Great brunch spot.,1
Service is friendly and inviting.,1
Very good lunch spot.,1
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.,0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.,0
Must have been an off night at this place.,0
"The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.",1
"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.",0
"For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.",0
My friend loved the salmon tartar.,1
Won't go back.,0
Extremely Tasty!,1
Waitress was good though!,1
Soggy and not good.,0
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.,1
Which are small and not worth the price.,0
"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!",0
The service was a bit lacking.,0
"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.",0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,0
"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.",0
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.,1
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!,1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.,1
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired.",0
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!,1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.,1
"If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.",0
Very very fun chef.,1
"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.",0
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.,1
"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.",0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.",0
"I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).",1
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.,0
"Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.",1
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.,0
Now this dish was quite flavourful.,1
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.,0
"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.",0
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.""",0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
"Seriously flavorful delights, folks.",1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.,1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.,1
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.,0
Owner's are really great people.!,1
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.,0
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.,1
"Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.",0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.,1
Fantastic service here.,1
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.,0
They know how to make them here.,1
very tough and very short on flavor!,0
I hope this place sticks around.,1
"I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.",0
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.,1

The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.,1
"Plus, it's only 8 bucks.",1

Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!,1
"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.",0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!,1
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.,1
You can't beat that.,1

The chefs were friendly and did a good job.,1
"I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.",0
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.,1

I think not again,0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.,0
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.,1
Service stinks here!,0
I waited and waited.,0
"This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.",0
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.,1
Great Pizza and Salads!,1
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.,0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.,0
This place is amazing!,1
"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.",0
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!,0
Just don't know why they were so slow.,0
"The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.",1
"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.",0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.,1
"You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.",1
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.,0
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.,1
Never again will I be dining at this place!,0
The food was excellent and service was very good.,1
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.,1
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.,0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.,0
Food was really boring.,0
Good Service-check!,1
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!,0
"Will never, ever go back.",0
"As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.",0
"In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.",1

But I definitely would not eat here again.,0
Do not waste your money here!,0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,1
The crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist.,1
Awful service.,0
Won't ever go here again.,0
Food quality has been horrible.,0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.,0
The service here is fair at best.,0
"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.",0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.,0
Very poor service.,0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.,0
"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.",1
They were excellent.,1
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.,0
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.,1
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,0
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!,1
"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.",0
The food came out at a good pace.,1
"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.",1
I won't be back.,0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!,0
This place deserves no stars.,0
I would not recommend this place.,0
"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.",1
"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.",0
"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!",0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.,1
I probably would not go here again.,0
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.,1
The price is reasonable and the service is great.,1
"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.",0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,0
"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.",1
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!,1
I probably won't be coming back here.,0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.,0
"This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.",1
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.,1
"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.",0
I love their fries and their beans.,1
Always a pleasure dealing with him.,1
"They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.",1
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.,1
"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.",1
"The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.",1
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.,0
"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.",0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,0
"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.",1
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.,1
Weird vibe from owners.,0
There was hardly any meat.,0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.,0
Go To Place for Gyros.,1
"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!",1
"Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.",0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.,0
"The service was terrible, food was mediocre.",0
We definately enjoyed ourselves.,1
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.,0
"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.",0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0
The service was extremely slow.,0
"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.",0
Seriously killer hot chai latte.,1
"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.",0
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.,1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,0
Worst Thai ever.,0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,1
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.,1
The pizza selections are good.,1
"I had strawberry tea, which was good.",1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,0
"Overall, a great experience.",1
Spend your money elsewhere.,0
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!,1
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,0
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!",0
"Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.",0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
We won't be returning.,0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,1
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,0
"Very, very sad.",0
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?",0
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!",0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it purÃ©ed.,0
"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better",0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.,0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!,0
"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.",0
"Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.",0
This place is disgusting!,0
"Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.",1
The RI style calamari was a joke.,0
"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.",0
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.",0
"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.",0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,0
Disappointing experience.,0
"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.",0
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",0
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,0
We won't be going back.,0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,0
This place lacked style!!,0
"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.",0
Don't bother coming here.,0
"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.",0
"The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.",0
It was equally awful.,0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,0
very slow at seating even with reservation.,0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,0
"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.",0
"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.",0
I was VERY disappointed!!,0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,0
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.",0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,0
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.",0
Con: spotty service.,0
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.",0
But then they came back cold.,0
"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.",0
The real disappointment was our waiter.,0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,0
"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.",0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!,0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,0
But I don't like it.,0
Hell no will I go back,0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all"".",0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0
The ambiance isn't much better.,0
"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.",0
The food wasn't good.,0
"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.",0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.,0
"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.",0
Overpriced for what you are getting.,0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,0
"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.",0
"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.",0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,0
Food was below average.,0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,0
"All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.",0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,0
"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.",0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,0
Spend your money and time some place else.,0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,0
the presentation of the food was awful.,0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.,0
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,0
Appetite instantly gone.,0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.,0
"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.",0
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.",0
The waitress greets us with her humble nature,1
The decor was horrifying,0
