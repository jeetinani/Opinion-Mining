So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!!

952,"Okay, here's an honest review. Went to the Dhanmondi Branch yesterday and the food was okay. It was nothing completely out of the ordinary and that would have been completely alright had the items not been priced premium. The service was absolutely horrible! I mean how are you guys still in business with the current lot of waiters? A waiter literally tried to force an item on us by repeatedly insisting in the rudest of manners and the most annoyed of expressions. We had to ca...ll the waiters multiple times before any of them responded, every time. No, they weren't busy, just standing at the nearest tissues counter (or something) doing absolutely nothing. It took them about 15 minutes to get the bill and another 15 to return the change. The music was too loud and they did not turn down the volume even after we requested them to. Please take note that we have not been rude to any of the servers even once through out the whole process. Now, considering the fact that the Dhanmondi branch is a relatively new outlet, the cutlery items used should still be in relatively good condition but they were not. Most of the spoons had so many scratch marks on them that it almost gave the feeling that we had been provided with used utensils from the older branches. Does not reflect the class BBQ BD claims to boast. Not a good experience overall. Not sure if I wanna go back there, not anytime soon at least.

They charged me the double on their bill around 3000tk. I have calculated on my own and it would have been around 1800tk-2000tk with vat and service charge. This was a clear fraud..

'experience' and interior for dining out,if that is so,the pricing is high because the place is ...really really really congested.There was this loud group of boys celebrating a birthday or something,but as common sense is most uncommon these days,the small space did not affect them to share incidents about their lives as loudly as possible.The staff maybe well behaved but the waiting time for food was so dispiriting(food was served as soon as we got up to leave) that there are no pictures to share.Also, if the food was extremely exciting that would have been a totally different

at tree house last night(18th september 2015) i am disappointed that i could not see through the reviews before agreeing to go for dinner with friends and a one year four month old we waited one and half hours for 3 chicken steak meals and 1 beef steak meal(there was just three options to choose from) i personally feel pricing should include the 'experience' and interior for dining out if that is so the pricing is high because the place is    really really really congested there was this loud group of boys celebrating a birthday or something but as common sense is most uncommon these days the small space did not affect them to share incidents about their lives as loudly as possible the staff maybe well behaved but the waiting time for food was so dispiriting(food was served as soon as we got up to leave) that there are no pictures to share also  if the food was extremely exciting that would have been a totally different story anyway maybe it was a bad day for me or maybe my expectations do not match the common good reviews about this place i will never frequent this place again,"['this', 'is', 'regarding', 'dining', 'experience', 'at', 'tree', 'house', 'last',
